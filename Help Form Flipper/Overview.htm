<h1><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">
<font color="#000080" size="4">Form Flipper<br>
</font></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">Form 
Flipper is the perfect program for those who write multi-language applications. 
This COM-based software adjusts your form’s alignment and orientation to support 
languages that use nonstandard layouts, such as right to left. It is designed to 
work with Form Translator, which automatically translates a finished form into 
languages. With Form Flipper, you can easily sell your application to 
international markets and better communicate your trade.<br>

<span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline"><br>
Auto code generation<br>
</span></font><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">Rather 
than rewrite a whole new code, Form Flipper simply alters the code on your 
original form. This not only makes it faster, but ensures consistency and allows 
easier editing later on. You only have to design one program, instead of 
rewriting your code for every new version.</font></span></h1>
<h1><font color="#000080" size="4">
<span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">Eastern language 
support<br>
</span></font><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">Form 
Flipper is one of the first programs to support Eastern languages such as 
Chinese and Arabic. In fact, it is designed specifically for the reverse 
orientation common in Eastern scripts. Form Flipper will automatically flip your 
from 180 degrees when it recognizes a language that calls for it.</font></span></h1>
<h1><font color="#000080" size="4">
<span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">Works with COM 
applications<br>
</span></font><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">Form 
Flipper easily integrates with any COM-based development application, such as 
Borland C++, Visual Basic, Visual C++, and Delphi. The flip function occupies 
only one line in the Form_Load event, so it won’t clutter your program. Also, 
since it uses very simple syntax, you can easily spot the Form Flipper code when 
you scan your project. </font></span></h1>
<h1><font color="#000080" size="4">
<span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">Quick installation 
and setup<br>
</span></font><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">Form Flipper 
installs in less than a minute on Windows s98, NT, 2000, and XP. Upon 
installation, it saves the file “</font><span lang="EN-GB"><font size="3">DC_FormFlipper10.dll” 
on the path C:\Windows\system32. Simply add this file as a reference (under the 
Project menu) to make it load automatically when you open your project.</font></span></span></h1>
<h1><font color="#000080" size="4">
